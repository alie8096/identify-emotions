        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper presents a comprehensive review of brain-heart connections using multimodal imaging techniques and cognitive-emotional games. The aim of this review is to identify and analyze cognitive and emotional patterns by combining brain and heart data. Modern imaging techniques such as ECG, EEG, and fMRI, along with the use of deep analysis tools, help in the more accurate identification of emotions and cognitive patterns.</p>
